                Renewable energy, such as wind and solar energy, plays an increasing role in the supply of energy worldwide.
                Wind energy is a key player in renewable energy production.

                However, levels of production of wind energy are hard to predict as they rely on weather conditions.
                Wind speed is crucial for energy production and varies over time.
